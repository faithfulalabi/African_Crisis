# African Crisis : Overview of dataset 

* __Context__:

This dataset is a derivative of Reinhart et. al's Global Financial Stability dataset which can be found online [here](https://www.hbs.edu/behavioral-finance-and-financial-stability/data/Pages/global.aspx)

The dataset will be valuable to those who seek to understand the dynamics of financial stability within the African context.

The dataset can also be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/chirin/africa-economic-banking-and-systemic-crisis-data)


* __Content__:

The dataset specifically focuses on the Banking, Debt, Financial, Inflation and Systemic Crisis that occurred from 1860 to 2014 in 13 African countries. Including: Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.


* __Motivation__: 

My inspiration for taking on this project comes first from the fact I was born in Nigeria and wanted to know the financial history of the country I was born in. Second is to determine which factors are most associated with Systemic Crisis in Africa? and at which annual rate of inflation does an Inflation Crisis become a practical certainty?

* __Variables__:

1) Domestic Debt in Default: Domestic debt is a central government's debt. It is debt issued by the lenders within the country (eg.Financial Institutions within the country).


2) Sovereign External Debt Default: External debt is the portion of a country's debt that was borrowed from foreign lenders, including commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions. These loans, including interest, must usually be paid in the currency in which the loan was made. To earn the needed currency, the borrowing country may sell and export goods to the lender's country.


3) Systemic Crisis: Systemic crisis is a domino effect in which financial trouble spreads between institutions and markets until it affects the whole financial system with dire global economic consequences.


4) Currency Crisis: A currency crisis is a situation in which serious doubt exists as to whether a country's central bank has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to maintain the country's fixed exchange rate. The crisis is often accompanied by a speculative attack in the foreign exchange market. A currency crisis results from chronic balance of payments deficits, and thus is also called a balance of payments crisis. Often such a crisis culminates in a devaluation of the currency.


5) Inflation Crisis: Inflation is a quantitative measure of the rate at which the average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy increases over a period of time. It is the constant rise in the general level of prices where a unit of currency buys less than it did in prior periods.


6) Banking Crisis: A banking crisis is often associated with financial crisis. It refers to a panic or a bank run during which investors sell off assets or withdraw money from savings accounts because they fear that the value of those assets will drop if they remain in a financial institution.

Oberservation of the first plot, we can see that for almost all african countries the exachange rates did not start flantuating till after 1960.
